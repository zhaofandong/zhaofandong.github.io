# Introduction to Web Development

Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. It can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.

## Front-End vs Back-End Development

### Front-End Development
Front-end development involves everything that users interact with directly:

- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for interactivity

Front-end developers focus on user experience and making sure that the interface is intuitive and visually appealing.

### Back-End Development
Back-end development refers to the server-side of development where the main focus is on:

- Databases
- Server logic
- APIs
- Authentication

Back-end developers ensure that the server, application, and database communicate with each other efficiently.

## Popular Web Development Frameworks

| Front-End Frameworks | Back-End Frameworks |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| React                | Express (Node.js)  |
| Angular              | Django (Python)    |
| Vue.js               | Ruby on Rails      |
| Svelte               | Laravel (PHP)      |

## Getting Started

If you're new to web development, I recommend starting with the basics:

1. Learn HTML and CSS
2. Get comfortable with JavaScript
3. Pick a framework once you understand the fundamentals
4. Learn about version control (Git)
5. Understand the basics of web servers and hosting

Remember, the best way to learn is by building projects. Start small and gradually increase complexity as you gain confidence and skills.

Happy coding!
